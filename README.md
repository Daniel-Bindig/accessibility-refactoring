# Accessibility Refactoring

## Description

This refactoring was created to make the code on the webpage provided more accessable for the users. The more accessible the website the higher it ranks in search engines. To make the webpage more accessable I added semantic elements that followed a logical order, added accessible alt attributes to the images, changed the headings to fall in sequential order and added a clear and concise title.
